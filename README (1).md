🤖 Model Card for Model ID: FaceAuthenticator.keras
📋 Model Details
📝 Model Description
The FaceAuthenticator.keras model is a deep learning model designed for face authentication tasks. It utilizes a VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract features from facial images and make predictions about whether the face belongs to an authorized individual. This model is typically used in applications such as face recognition systems for security or access control.
Developed by: Prathmesh Patil 
Model type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

🛠️ Uses
👍 Direct Use
The FaceAuthenticator.keras model can be directly used for face authentication tasks without the need for fine-tuning. 🔒
🔧 Downstream Use
This model can be fine-tuned for specific face authentication tasks or integrated into larger systems for access control and security applications. 🛡️
❌ Out-of-Scope Use
The model may not work well for faces that significantly differ from those in the training data. It is not suitable for tasks outside of face authentication. 🚫

⚠️ Bias, Risks, and Limitations
The model's performance may be affected by biases present in the training data, such as underrepresentation of certain demographics. Additionally, it may struggle with low-quality images or faces occluded by accessories like glasses or hats. ⚠️

💡 Recommendations
Users should be aware that the model was trained with a specific dataset and may not generalize well to all populations. Consider additional authentication methods or human verification for critical decisions based on its predictions. 🤔
